## Meeting Notes
Tim Brownawell will be presenting about [WebAssembly](http://webassembly.org/)

WebAssembly is a new, efficient alternative to JavaScript. It has recently reached "Minimum Viable Product" status, and is available in the major browsers.

This talk will cover
 - How it works, and what tools you need to use it
 - What it can do and how it can interoperate with JavaScript for the things it can't do
 - what future improvements are planned
